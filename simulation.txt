======== Run 1 =========
Baloon#B1 (1): I didn't sign up for this! I thought I was lighter than air, not fog!
Baloon#B2 (2): Why did I think hot air rises in a snowstorm?
JetPlane#J1 (3): I'm a JetPlane, not a SnowPlane!
Helicopter#H1 (4): Why did I think flying in a winter wonderland was a good idea?
Helicopter#H2 (5): Why did I think flying in a winter wonderland was a good idea?
Helicopter#H3 (6): Looks like I need to switch on my roto-lights!
Baloon#B3 (7): I'm ballooning with joy in this sunny, sky-high paradise!
JetPlane#J2 (8): I'm feeling supersonic, gotta love the sunny skies!
Helicopter#H4 (9): I guess it's raining cats and helicopters now!
========================
======== Run 2 =========
Baloon#B1 (1): I'm ballooning with joy in this sunny, sky-high paradise!
Baloon#B2 (2): I guess I picked the wrong day for an up-in-the-air car wash!
JetPlane#J1 (3): I hope the rain doesn't wash off my new coat of paint!
Helicopter#H1 (4): Why did I think flying in a winter wonderland was a good idea?
Helicopter#H1(4) landing.
